# Currently there is no official Tensorflow build that works
# I managed to get DFL running on RTX 5090, but with updated libraries, there are MANY bugs that need to be fixed
# I will be updating this repository with an installation guide as soon as there is an official working Tensorflow build
# And lastly since Tensorflow does not have builds for Windows anymore, this fork will move everything to Linux (WSL)
